                        <p> Once the legend Martin Luther king denied the theory of importance of marks and enforced the significance of 
                        potential and experience one gains during their life's journey.</p>
                        <p>The question has always been a point of debate that never ends and probably will never be concluded to a solution. 
                        The only way out from this is the personal beliefs an individual adopt to dwell into their particular comfortable surrounding 
                        so as to gain and secure themselves according to their convenience and will.</p>
                        <p>Talking about social strata one can say that the marks is one of the most difficult and important nail to drill. 
                        Importance of marks has been enhanced by the prevalent competition system which enforces each and every individual to 
                        fight for numbers and somewhere creates a hard rock to be carried so as to complete the climbing of ladders of success. 
                        Claiming that marks doesn't matter can be a statement of stretch. Marks has become the reasons for students burns their 
                        late night oils, compelled to grind themselves, coaching institutions becoming its beneficiaries are earning more than enough 
                        of ugly profit, the race to score high has become the trophy of gold and making it one restrictions of seats became the cherry
                         over the cake.</p>
                         <p>One cannot deny the system completely even after wholly disagreeing with it especially if you're a citizen of India,
                        a country with one of the highest rate of population. The reason behind the statement is that though the system creates 
                        the unnecessary pressure, prejudice, mental crisis and development crisis it is the only closest fair method to go on for
                        the admission and selection procedure of the apt candidate.these marks and number games are only valid for the individual 
                        just to get enter in any institutions one wish to study in or work for. It is the only justified way that can be accepted
                        in such country in such scenarios.Though with this i would like to mention that only marks doesn't matter there are number
                        of other aspectd one needs learn, marks are just a step ahead and rest is learned by practice patience and hard work and 
                        these assets are always favourable for one true successful human being.</p>
