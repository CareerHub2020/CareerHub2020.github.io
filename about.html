                <p>As a group project, our team was put under a task to create anything we want, in the field we want to excel.
                We all came to a conclusion to create a dynamic website. Now, our question was, about what? Running through options, we started
                thinking about what situations we've faced in our lives, when we got fed up and wondered if we had a website for that problem to make
                our lives simpler.</p>
                <p>Here is a combination of all the educational websites which provide you with information about various courses and colleges
                in India which a student can pursue after his/her schooling. No more visiting a number of websites and not get satisfied.
                CareerHub is a complete solution!</p>
                <p>CareerHub also has a personalized counselor where you can simply answer a few questions and get information where and how to apply
                for your higher studies. Isn't that impressive?</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Mission</h3>
                <p>Our mission is to help out students who want to know their options for higher studies, with exact, to the point details.</p>

                    <p>I got really amazed when I first used HTML and saw the changes reflect on the browser window, 
                    it felt like magic. Since then I’ve been keen on learning various aspects of web development. 
                    I love working on the front end, but my passion is dancing. I love to juggle between academics 
                    and extracurricular, it’s fun.</p><br>
                    <p>This was the first-ever group project I worked on, in college. This is really close to my heart as 
                    it really taught me how to deal with a team and also while developing it, I learned many new technologies, 
                    platforms, and features in this aspect of Computers. We faced many problems, but I am so happy we could 
                    deliver not just a boring project, but a meaningful thought that can bring about change if implemented 
                    completely on a larger scale.</p>

                    <p>I am a graphic designer with interests in sketching and music. My stream in 12th standard was Science 
                    with Computers. Being a self taught graphic designer, I am always exploring new things about my passion. 
                    Graphics attracted me because I love to draw and use my creative mind.</p><br>
                    <p>This is my first group project and when I heard of it I was super excited because I know I could learn 
                    different things from it. I have such cooperative team members so I didn’t face many problems. Teamwork 
                    requires a lot of cooperation and understanding. So here we are doing such a great thing for all of us. 
                    I am a graphic designer, but of course, I learned so many things about creating a website and much more.</p>

                    <h3>Anjali Rawat</h3>
                    <p>I was always excited about the computer classes and labs in the school. Later, I chose computers as 
                    one of my subjects in school and since I was into programming, I picked web designing as my course in college. 
                    Learning a new language is always challenging and with a computer language, your mind starts thinking logically, 
                    which is the best part. I love working on gaining more knowledge and improving my skills.</p><br>
                    <p>I was really excited when I heard about this project.
                    The first project is always remembered and one puts a lot of hard work in it for the perfect output, 
                    and so did we. At first, I wasn’t ready to work on any project because I felt that I still didn’t have 
                    enough knowledge but as it is said- “the secret to getting ahead is getting started”, no matter if you 
                    are ready or not, you just need to start somewhere and you’ll never know what surprise life is going to 
                    give you next. This project taught me a lot of things that I would’ve never known myself including, 
                    challenges faced while working together, but one learns and experiences a lot of new things this way. 
                    I’m looking forward to doing more such innovative projects.  Good team + good ideas = successful output.</p>

                    <h3>Nishtha Chib</h3>
                    <p>When I was a kid I was always fascinated by computers around me and wanted to do anything I could. 
                    My first proper interaction with computers was when I was in 3rd, through a small course in Bal Bhawan. 
                    The first computer language I learned was HTML. My focus presently is on exploring as much as I can, to 
                    work with different languages and applications, and do well in the field.</p><br>
                    <p>Working as a part of a group is all about teamwork and finding out ways to help each other and grow 
                    as a person and group. Since I’m working 
                    with my classmates it is already a comfortably established environment but we tried to make it professional too. 
                    We distributed the work between us in such a manner that all of us are able to learn something new from the 
                    project as well as from each other. We came across many problems, but we all pitched in suggestions while 
                    deciding the platform for hosting the website, aesthetics, the logo of the website, and much more. This 
                    project is really special for all of us as the thought of this website came from the problems we faced while 
                    deciding our paths. We want to help as many students as we can and if we succeed in helping even a few students 
                    like us, the motive behind this project will be fulfilled.</p>

                    <p>I did my class 12th with biology and maths. So when I picked this field, it was entirely new for me but 
                    it also looked very appealing, therefore I started learning it from scratch. I love listening to music, 
                    and sometimes, I like to draw. I am really looking forward in this field.</p><br>
                    <p>This was my first group project in college, of the kind. I always thought about how people build 
                    these projects, and now I was getting to do it with my friends so it is all really special and new for me. 
                    I gained an understanding of different technologies, their features, saw some new platforms, and was 
                    also able to acquire new skills while working. It is really satisfying that it also taught me to work 
                    in a team and deal with it. Our mistakes taught us lessons too. I think our project can actually be a 
                    practical solution to real-life issues.</p>

                <p>If we take rough estimations, around 60% students find it difficult to finalize their careers and come across various decision making
                problems while choosing a field. Studying Indian culture and mindsets, many parents still force their children into taking up
                courses they don't want.</p>
                <p>We can't directly affect that aspect, but help the student know about his/her options and give them information
                to ponder over, so that they can be sure of their interests and possibly stand up for themselves.</p>
                <p>If our initiative could help even 1 in a 100 students to get to the course / college of his/her choice, it would be great. At least
                they won't face the difficulties we faced while choosing our careers, and that would mean a lot :)</p>
