                <h2 class="text-center">Streams & Fields</h2>
                <p>In India, you generally get to choose between 3 streams in classes 11th & 12th, namely Science, Commerce, and Humanities (or Arts). Each stream is unique and has its own kind of challenges for a student. It's not necessary that a student great at Math can graciously pass Science, or a language loving student can score high in Arts.</p>
                <p>Every student has its own interest and capabilities and should not be compared with  another on the basis of marks. Also, these streams do not enable you to judge a studentâ€™s IQ. Till a few years back, the calibre of a student was measured on the basis of the stream s/he gets (because of course, in India, the marking scheme divisions set the eligibility of the streams.) But now, people have started encouraging all streams equally, which is a wonderful change.</p>
                <p>We all are looking forward to the changes from The National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020), which was approved by the Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020 to come into motion, as it will remove the general distinction between streams and enable a student to take up all the subjects of his/her choice.</p>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h3 class="text-center">Science Stream</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/science.png" style="width:100%">
                    <p>Science Stream in India is mainly divided into 2 sub-categories, which are- Medical and Non-Medical. Medical consists of Physics, Chemistry, Biology whereas, Non-Medical includes Physics, Chemistry, Maths. One can opt for Computers with Non-Medical and Maths with Medical as well.</p>
                    <p>The stream of Science can make you eligible for Graduate courses such as Engineering, Honors in any of the Science subjects, all sorts of Medical courses, NDA, defence courses, etc. It is also believed that one can change their lines if s/he had Science.</p>
                    <p>Science in general broadens the logical thinking of a student, increases the ways in which one can see a problem, gives you a scientific touch in theories, and possibly sharpens your brain.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h3 class="text-center">Humanities Stream</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/humanities.png" style="width:100%">
                    <p>Humanities, or generally known as Arts stream consists of subjects like Visual and Performing Arts, Literary Arts, History, Geography, Political Science. Some institutions provide an option to students to opt for Maths or Information Practices with an Arts stream.</p>
                    <p>The stream of Humanities enables you to pursue courses like Language Specialization, Journalism, Psychology, Travel & Tourism, Arts/Fine Arts, Design, Hotel Management, etc. This stream tests your creative side, enables you to learn new things everyday, go into vast details of the subjects and make you a better person.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <h3 class="text-center">Commerce Stream</h3>
                <img src="assets/images/commerce.png" style="width:100%">
                    <p>Commerce stream can be taken with or without Maths. Its main subjects are Accountancy, Business Studies and Economics. Many institutions also provide an option to the student to opt for Information Practices as an extra subject with Commerce.</p>
                    <p>The stream of Commerce can lead you to Honors in any of the Commerce subjects, management courses, Business related courses, Banking, CA, etc.</p>
                    <p>Commerce makes your brain calculate fast, it gives you an ability to think how a business actually works, and also gives you knowledge about how the exchange of goods and services is done from producer to final consumer, basically how a business or management works.</p>
